# MaskedAIRevamp

##Announcement
This mod was canceled due to my lack of skills and maintenance difficulties in the past.
Instead, please use [LethalIntelligence](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/VirusTLNR/LethalIntelligenceExperimental/), a great mod developed by VirusTLNR based on this mod.

## Information
Improves Masked's AI to be more complex.

All clients must have this mode installed for it to work!

There are features that work together when installed with RugbugRedfern's SkinWalkers mod.

The current version is a **very very early** version, no optimization work has been done, so you may experience significant frame drops even with high PC specs!!!

*Also... There may be tons of bugs.*
